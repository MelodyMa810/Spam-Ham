# Spam & Ham

Spam & Ham was a project I did in Data 100 - Principles and Techniques of Data Science.


In this project, I built a classifier to distinguish between spam and ham emails through logistic regression by exploring the given dataset of ~9,000 spam and ham emails. To mitigate the risks of underfitting and overfitting, I employed a five-fold cross validation approach.
